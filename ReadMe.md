## 🔸Approach
#### Based on the above topics, questions have been asked to which answers are given and are summarized indiviualy.
#### Inferences drawn are then visualized for better depiction and understanding.  
  

#### 🔸Data Wrangling  
Combining Data Across 10 Years into a Single Dataset.
#### 🔸Data Pre-Processing  
Data Cleaning and Checking for Missing Values.
#### 🔸Data Analysis  
Analysing Various Areas of Study in the English Premier League.  
#### 🔸Data Visualization  
Visualising Inferences Drawn from Analysis.  
  
<br><br>  
  
## 🔸Requirements  
#### Jupyter Notebook  
#### Python  
     Packages:
            os              #Functions for Interaction with OS  
                            (To get Path for Datasets)  
            glob            #Retrieving Files of Specified Pattern from a Path  
                            ( .xlsx Datasets for Uploading, Combining and Saving)  
            numpy           #Arithmetic Operations  
            pandas          #Data Analysis and Manipulation  
            matplotlib      #Data Visualization and Plotting  
   
<br><br>  
  
## 🔸Setup  
Install Python and Jupyter Notebook if not done already.  
Download **FootballAnalysis** Folder with all files present.   
Ensure 10 Years of Datasets are Present.  
Open and Initialize **FootballAnalysis.ipynb** on Jupyter Notebook.  
  
*Note:  
Datasets can be found [Here.](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php)  
To Find or Understand  meaning of the abbreviations of columns in the Dataset, Refer to [DatasetKeys.txt](https://github.com/GarethSequeira/Football-Analysis/blob/main/FootballAnalysis/DatasetKeys.txt) in the [FootballAnalysis](https://github.com/GarethSequeira/Football-Analysis/tree/main/FootballAnalysis) Folder.  
If Code Needs to be Run Multiple times, Ensure File 'CombinedData.xlsx' is Deleted before **.xlsx** Datasets are uploaded for, Combining and Saving as this Will Cause Duplication of Data Leading to Errors.*

## 🔸Summary  
A Decade Overview of the Premier League is Done Sucessfully.  
Visualization is Done from Inferred Data Post Analysis.
